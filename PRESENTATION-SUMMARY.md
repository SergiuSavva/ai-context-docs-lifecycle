# AI Context Docs Lifecycle - Short Description

## Elevator Pitch

**AI Context Docs Lifecycle** solves AI coding assistants' memory problem by turning documentation into AI knowledge. A modular toolkit with 4 progressive modules that encode your project patterns once—every AI session follows them automatically.

**Problem**: AI assistants have no memory → generic code, constant re-explaining, lost decisions.

**Solution**: Documentation as AI knowledge → consistent code, zero re-explaining, preserved decisions.

**Time**: 5 minutes to start with Module 1 (`AGENTS.md`), add modules as needed.

**Result**: AI understands your project, follows your patterns, maintains consistency.
