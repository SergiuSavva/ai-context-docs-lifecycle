# Project: AI Context Docs Lifecycle

## Why?

AI coding assistants lack memory and context about YOUR project. This causes:
- Generic, inconsistent code
- Constant re-explaining
- Contradictory suggestions

**Solution**: Documentation as AI memory.

| Folder | Contains |
|--------|----------|
| `content/modules/` | 4 core modules with templates |
| `content/guides/` | Step-by-step adoption instructions |
