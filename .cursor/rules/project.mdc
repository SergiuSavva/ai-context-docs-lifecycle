# Project: AI Context Docs Lifecycle

## Why?

AI coding assistants lack memory and context about YOUR project. This causes:
- Generic, inconsistent code
- Constant re-explaining
- Contradictory suggestions

**Solution**: Documentation as AI memory.

---

## What?

A methodology reference that AI agents read and apply to projects.

| Folder | Contains |
|--------|----------|
| `content/rules/` | Required rules (structure, workflow) |
| `content/templates/` | Skeleton files with placeholders (AI copies these) |
| `content/examples/` | Filled-in reference samples (for understanding) |
| `content/guides/` | Step-by-step instructions |

## How?
