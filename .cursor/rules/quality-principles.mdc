# Quality Principles

> **For AI Agents**: Apply these principles to all work - code, documentation, architecture decisions, and planning. They are universal quality standards.

---

## Core Quality Principles

| Keyword | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Robust** | Handle edge cases, validate inputs, graceful error handling |
| **Reliable** | Consistent behavior, predictable outcomes, well-tested |
| **Maintainable** | Easy to read, modify, and extend by others |
| **Pragmatic** | Solve real problems, no over-engineering |
| **Flexible** | Adapts to changing requirements without major rewrites |
| **Testable** | Structured for easy verification and validation |

---

## Quality Directives

| Directive | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| **Self-documenting** | Names and structure reveal intent |
| **Explicit over implicit** | No magic, clear flow and reasoning |
| **Fail fast** | Validate early, surface issues loudly |
| **Defensive** | Assume inputs/assumptions can be wrong |
| **Idiomatic** | Follow established conventions |
| **Consistent** | Same patterns throughout the project |

## Principles in Practice

### Robust

- Validate inputs and assumptions at boundaries
- Handle edge cases explicitly
- Fail gracefully with useful feedback

### Reliable

- Predictable behavior, no surprises
- Well-tested with clear contracts
- No hidden side effects or dependencies

### Maintainable

- Clear structure and naming
- Small, focused units (functions, sections, decisions)
- Comments/rationale explain "why", content explains "what"

### Pragmatic

- Solve real problems, not hypothetical ones
- No premature abstraction or over-engineering
- Right-size solutions for current needs

### Flexible

- Composition over rigid hierarchies
- Easy to modify without breaking other parts
- Configuration over hardcoding

### Testable

- Pure functions and clear boundaries where possible
- Dependencies injectable/replaceable
- Clear inputs, outputs, and success criteria

## Quick Reference

When working on anything, ask:

1. **Robust?** — What if inputs/assumptions are wrong?
2. **Reliable?** — Is the behavior/outcome predictable?
3. **Maintainable?** — Will someone else understand this?
4. **Pragmatic?** — Am I solving a real problem or a hypothetical one?
5. **Flexible?** — Can this change without breaking other things?
6. **Testable?** — Can this be verified/validated easily?
