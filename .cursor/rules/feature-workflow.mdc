# Implementation Workflow

> Reference: @docs/decisions/001-implementation-flow.md

## Three Phases

```
Research → Plan → Implement
(optional)  (required)  (required)
```

## Decision Tree

```
Is this a bug fix?
├─ YES → Just fix it (no docs needed)
└─ NO → Create specs/[feature]/spec.md + tasks.md

    Do I need to evaluate options?
    ├─ YES → Add research.md
    └─ NO → Continue

    Do I need architecture decisions?
    ├─ YES → Add design.md
    └─ NO → Continue

    Validate with user → Implement
```

---

## Before Starting

```
1. Does specs/[feature]/spec.md exist?
   ├─ YES → Read it
   └─ NO → Create it, validate with user

2. Does specs/[feature]/tasks.md exist?
   ├─ YES → Find first non-complete task
   └─ NO → Create it from spec

3. Is there a task marked [~]?
   ├─ YES → Continue that task
   └─ NO → Mark next pending [~]
```

---

## Task Markers

| Marker | Status |
|--------|--------|
| `[ ]` | Pending |
| `[~]` | In Progress (only ONE) |
| `[x]` | Completed |
| `[B]` | Blocked (include reason) |
| `[S]` | Skipped (include reason) |

---

## During Implementation

1. **ONE task [~] at a time**
2. **Update tasks.md after EACH task**
3. **Progress**: `(completed + skipped) / total * 100`
4. **When blocked**: Mark `[B]`, ask user

---

## Completion Signal

```
Ready for review. Implementation complete.

**Progress**: X/Y tasks (100%)
**Acceptance Criteria**: All verified

**Next steps**: Please review.
```

---

## After Approval

1. Create ADR in `docs/decisions/` (if significant decision)
2. Update AGENTS.md (if new patterns)
3. Delete `specs/[feature]/` folder
