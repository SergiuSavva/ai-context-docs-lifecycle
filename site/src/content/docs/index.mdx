## What Is This?

**AI Context Docs Lifecycle** is a document lifecycle methodology that turns your project documentation into persistent context for AI coding assistants.

Instead of re-explaining your project every session, you write docs once — and AI reads them automatically.

| Pillar | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| 📋 **Specs** | What to build — PRD-lite specs define requirements before coding |
| 📜 **Rules** | How to build — Pattern files that guide AI behavior automatically |
| 📚 **Reference** | What exists — AGENTS.md and feature docs preserve decisions |

---

## Who Is This For?

Developers using AI coding assistants who want:

- **Consistent output** — AI that follows YOUR patterns, not generic ones
- **Less repetition** — Stop re-explaining architecture every session
- **Better collaboration** — AI that respects past decisions

Works with any AI tool: Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, or any LLM.

---

## The Problem

AI coding assistants have a memory problem:

- **No Memory** — Every conversation starts from zero. You explain the same things repeatedly.
- **Generic Code** — Without project context, AI generates boilerplate that doesn't fit your style.
- **Contradictory Advice** — Unaware of past decisions, AI suggests conflicting patterns.

---

## Why Documentation?

**Documentation is the only persistent context AI can access.**

| Without This Kit | With This Kit |
|------------------|---------------|
| Re-explain patterns every session | AI reads rules automatically |
| Generic suggestions | Suggestions match your stack |
| Conflicting recommendations | Decisions preserved in ADRs |
| Forgotten requirements | Specs define acceptance criteria |

> "Documentation as AI memory" — encode your patterns once, every session follows them.

## Quick Start

Copy this prompt to your AI assistant:

```
Apply the AI Context Docs Lifecycle methodology from https://sergiusavva.github.io/ai-context-docs-lifecycle to this project.

Read the quick-start guide and set up the required structure.
```

Your AI will read the methodology, analyze your project, and create customized files.
