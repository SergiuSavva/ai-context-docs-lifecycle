## Key Difference

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="New Project">
    - Create ideal structure from start
    - Define patterns before building
    - Full workflow from day one
    - Templates used as-is, then customized
  </Card>
  <Card title="Existing Project">
    - Document what IS, not what should be
    - Capture existing patterns
    - Adopt workflow incrementally
    - Templates adapted to match reality
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Common Questions

### Project has a README but no AGENTS.md

Keep README.md for humans. Create AGENTS.md for AI with technical details, quick commands, and pattern references.

### Project has scattered documentation

Create `docs/INDEX.md` linking to existing docs. Don't move files initially — consolidate gradually as you update them.

### Project has undocumented patterns

Start with AGENTS.md covering main patterns. Create rule files as you encounter AI generating inconsistent code.

### Using different folder structure

Document YOUR structure, don't change it. Use rules to tell AI where things go in your project. Adapt templates to match your conventions.

### Team has different tooling

The methodology is tool-agnostic. Adapt rule file format:
- **Cursor**: `.cursor/rules/*.mdc`
- **Claude Code**: `CLAUDE.md`
- **Copilot**: `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Other**: Standard `.md` files
