## Documentation Philosophy

### Principles

1. **Document decisions, not descriptions** - Why, not just what
2. **Keep docs close to code** - AGENTS.md in feature directories
3. **Update or delete** - Stale docs are worse than no docs
4. **AI-first formatting** - Structured for machine parsing

## Essential Documents

| Document | Purpose | Update Frequency |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| `AGENTS.md` | AI context | When patterns change |
| `docs/INDEX.md` | Human navigation | When structure changes |
| `docs/TASKS.md` | Progress tracking | Daily/per-task |
| `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` | AI rules | When conventions change |
| `docs/features/*/` | Feature docs | Per feature change |

## AGENTS.md Pattern

### Root AGENTS.md

Located at project root - loaded for every AI interaction:

```markdown
# Project - AI Agent Instructions

## Quick Start
[Essential commands]

## Tech Stack
[Key technologies]

## Architecture
[High-level patterns]

## Need Help?
[Links to detailed docs]
```

### Feature AGENTS.md

Located in feature directories:

```markdown
# Feature: [Name]

## Key Files
[Important locations]

## Patterns
[Feature-specific conventions]

## Dependencies
[Related features/services]
```

---

## Feature Documentation

### Folder Structure

```
docs/features/<feature-name>/
├── README.md              # Overview + code touchpoints
├── user-stories.md        # User stories + acceptance criteria
└── tasks.md               # Implementation checklist
```

### When to Create

- New feature with multiple user stories
- Feature spanning multiple files/components
- Feature with complex business logic

---

## Architecture Decision Records

### When to Write an ADR

- Choosing between technologies
- Defining architectural patterns
- Making irreversible decisions
- Establishing conventions

### ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Title]

## Status: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated

## Context
[What prompted this decision?]

## Decision
[What did we decide?]

## Consequences
[What are the implications?]

## Alternatives Considered
[What else was evaluated?]
```

---

## Update Triggers

| Event | Update |
|-------|--------|
| New pattern established | Add to rules |
| Architecture change | Update AGENTS.md |
| Feature completed | Update feature docs |
| Task finished | Update TASKS.md |
| Breaking change | Add to changelog |

---

## Markdown Formatting

### For AI Parsing

```markdown
# Use clear hierarchy

## Section with context

### Subsection

| Structured | Data |
|------------|------|
| In tables | When possible |

- Bullet points for lists
- Keep items concise
```

### Avoid

- Long paragraphs without structure
- Deeply nested content (>3 levels)
- Inline code for long snippets
- Ambiguous references

## Documentation Checklist

When reviewing docs:

- [ ] AGENTS.md reflects current project state
- [ ] Rules match actual patterns used
- [ ] TASKS.md has current progress
- [ ] Stale docs identified and removed
- [ ] Links are valid
