# Doc Style

> **Template**: Copy to `.cursor/rules/doc-style.mdc`
> These rules apply when AI generates or edits documentation.

---

## Three Rules

1. **Value only** - Include only information that helps someone
2. **Mermaid for diagrams** - Visual > text for complex flows
3. **Structure over prose** - Tables and bullets, not paragraphs

---

## Value Only

Ask: "Does this help someone do something?"

| Include | Skip |
|---------|------|
| How to do X | History of X |
| What to avoid | Obvious statements |
| Quick reference | Verbose explanations |

```markdown
# Good: Actionable
Run `npm install` then `npm run dev`

# Bad: No value added
This project uses npm for package management.
```

## Diagrams vs Tables

| Context | Use |
|---------|-----|
| **AI-read files** (AGENTS.md, .mdc rules) | Tables - fewer tokens, AI parses text not visuals |
| **Human-read docs** (READMEs, guides) | Mermaid - visual clarity for complex flows |

### When to Use Mermaid

- Workflows with 4+ steps
- Architecture with multiple components
- Sequence diagrams (interactions)

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Spec --> Build --> Review --> Deploy
```

### When to Use Tables

- Simple relationships (A references B)
- Lists of items with attributes
- AGENTS.md Context Loading section

```markdown
| Module 1 | → | Module 2 |
|----------|---|----------|
| AGENTS.md | references | .cursor/rules |
```

Keep diagrams simple. If it needs explanation, simplify it.

---

## Structure Over Prose

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| Long paragraphs | Bullet points |
| Inline lists | Tables |
| Narrative | Headers + short sections |

```markdown
# Good: Scannable
| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `dev` | Start server |
| `test` | Run tests |

# Bad: Wall of text
To start the development server you can run the dev command.
If you want to run tests instead, use the test command.
```

## Customization

Add your project-specific documentation patterns below:

### README Structure

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Quick Start
## Overview
## Installation
## Usage
## API Reference
## Contributing
```

### Code Comments

```
# When to comment:
- Complex algorithms
- Non-obvious business logic
- Workarounds with context

# When NOT to comment:
- Self-explanatory code
- Obvious variable assignments
```
