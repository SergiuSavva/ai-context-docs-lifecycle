# Documentation Style - SpaceBooker

> **Example**: This is a filled-in doc style rule for a project.

## Principles

1. **Minimal**: Don't document obvious things
2. **Current**: Stale docs are worse than no docs
3. **Scannable**: Headers, bullets, tables - no walls of text
4. **For AI**: AGENTS.md is primary context for AI agents

## File Types

| File | Purpose | Location | Update When |
|------|---------|----------|-------------|
| AGENTS.md | AI context | Root | Patterns/stack change |
| Feature README | How feature works | docs/features/ | Feature changes |
| ADR | Why we decided | docs/decisions/ | Never (immutable) |
| INDEX.md | Navigation | docs/ | New docs added |

## AGENTS.md Structure

Required sections:
1. Quick Start (commands)
2. Project Overview (1-2 sentences)
3. Tech Stack (table)
4. File Organization (tree)
5. Key Patterns (bullets)
6. Common Gotchas (numbered)

## Feature README Structure

```markdown
# Feature: [Name]

## Overview
[What this feature does - 2-3 sentences]

## How It Works
[Brief explanation or diagram]

## Code Touchpoints
- `path/to/main/file.ts` - Main logic
- `path/to/component.tsx` - UI component

## Usage
[Code example if applicable]

## Related
- [ADR-NNN](../decisions/NNN-title.md)
- [Related feature](../features/related/)
```

## ADR Structure

```markdown
# ADR-NNN: [Title]

## Status
Accepted

## Context
[Problem and constraints]

## Decision
[What we chose]

## Rationale
[Why we chose it]

## Consequences
[Trade-offs]

## Alternatives Considered
[What we rejected and why]
```

## Formatting Rules

### Code Blocks

Always specify language:

```typescript
const user = await getUser(id);
```

Not:

```
const user = await getUser(id);
```

### Tables

Keep to 3-4 columns max:

| Good | Better | Best |
|------|--------|------|
| x | y | z |

### Diagrams

Use Mermaid, keep simple:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    User --> API --> DB
```

### Links

Use relative paths:

```markdown
See [auth docs](../features/auth/README.md)
```

## Don't Document

- Obvious code behavior
- Things that change frequently
- Implementation details
- Duplicates of existing docs

## When to Update

| Event | Update |
|-------|--------|
| New pattern | AGENTS.md |
| Feature complete | Feature README |
| Architecture decision | ADR |
| Files moved | Code touchpoints |
| Tech stack change | AGENTS.md |
