## When to Create an ADR

Create an ADR when ANY of these are true:

- ✅ Evaluated 2+ alternatives and chose one
- ✅ Introduced a new architectural pattern
- ✅ Made a breaking change
- ✅ Chose a third-party library/service
- ✅ Made a significant trade-off decision

Do NOT create an ADR for:

- ❌ Following existing patterns
- ❌ Minor refactoring
