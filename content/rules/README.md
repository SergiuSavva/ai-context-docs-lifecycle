# Required Rules

> **For AI Agents**: These rules are MANDATORY for all projects using the AI Context Docs Lifecycle methodology.

---

## What Are Required Rules?

Required rules define the **non-negotiable foundation** that every project must have to work with AI agents effectively. They ensure:

1. **Consistent structure** - AI knows where to find and place files
2. **Predictable workflow** - AI follows the same process every time
3. **Quality output** - Documentation stays current and useful

---

## Rules Index

| Rule | File | Purpose |
|------|------|---------|
| **Structure** | [00-structure.md](./00-structure.md) | Required folder structure |
| **Workflow** | [01-workflow.md](./01-workflow.md) | Required docs-as-code workflow |
| **Code Style** | [02-code-style.md](./02-code-style.md) | Required code quality principles |

---

## How to Apply These Rules

### For New Projects

1. Read `00-structure.md` - Create the required folders and files
2. Read `01-workflow.md` - Follow the workflow from day one
3. Read `02-code-style.md` - Apply quality principles to all code
4. Use `../templates/` - Copy templates as starting points
5. Reference `../examples/` - See filled-in examples for understanding

### For Existing Projects

1. Read `00-structure.md` - Add missing required files
2. Read `01-workflow.md` - Adopt the workflow incrementally
3. Read `02-code-style.md` - Apply to new and refactored code
4. Check `../guides/existing-project.md` - Step-by-step migration

## Rule Principles

- **Minimal**: Only what's necessary, nothing more
- **Universal**: Works for any tech stack
- **Flexible**: Adapt templates to your needs
- **AI-First**: Optimized for AI agent comprehension

---

## What's NOT Required

These are optional and depend on your project:

- Language-specific patterns (use your team's conventions)
- Testing strategies (use your preferred approach)
- State management patterns (framework-dependent)

Use `../templates/cursor-rules/` for skeleton rules, see `../examples/cursor-rules/` for filled-in examples.
